## Intro

So, this could trip could be done in either direction, with the start/final destinations being Cape Town and Johanesburg.
The route would look something like so ![Route Map](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67912111/244669641-1ffdc130-c662-47f1-ae8c-b9134b12e15b.png)

On to the garden route.

Driving accross from cape town to knysna is roughly 7 hours, so if you want to stop along the way, there is a plethora of 
options if a small fishing town with nice beaches is what you're after. IF you're after something else, there are 0 options lmao.

A couple options:
- Sedgefield 
- Stillbaai

Also worth stopping off at the harbour in Mossel Bay for some seadfood - its epic.

Knysna is a town worth stopping in. The town itself is okay, and its reasonably sized. Its worth remebering that something 
considered a small town in the US or UK which would probably be dead af. will actually be pretty bustling in SA a lot of the time.
The town is and its surroundings are very picturesque and potentially worth doing a little walkabout in the woods (beware, they have elephants in the woods).

A bit further down the road you've got Natures Valley, which is probably one of the most stunning beaches i've been to. Its quite remote, with just a few 
holiday shacks around, and the nearest store (when i was last there in 2019) was a roadside farm stall lol. But the beach is backed by 
temperate rainforest covered mountains, and has a lagoon to swim in, which is ideal, as the sea here has sharks.

Next, on to Jeffreys Bay (meh home town, G) - its a sleepy surf town that only really comes alive during the holidays, and surf competitions.
But you can spot dolphins and wales from the shore sometimes which is nice. Ther eare some good festivals there if we happen to go 
at the right time. Other than that, theres a few good surf shops that do sustainable clothing, so i always stop for a new t-shirt.

On to Gqebergha. Have fun pronouncing that one. Its a large city - not a much point going into the city, but normally i stop to see family freinds.
Its both known as the friendly city and the windy city. Theres always a sea breeze which is nice because its often 40 celcius in the summer.
Because of the win, the beaches in this area are pretty unqiue - the sand dunes are massive, and have been known to envelope buldings.
Theres also a spot on one road, where do to what i imagine is an optical illusion, you can park your car, and it will roll uphill - spooky.
Basically, stop for some good coffee, some friends, phat beaches, and i'll probably get a haircut as I like one of the barbers there.
Theres also Addo Elephant park just outside of the city (1.5 hours). Its a massive game reserve that not only has what seems to be a 
billion elephants (they're like pigeons here), but also all of the other characters from the lion king.
 
From here, the next stop if flexible - we could journey on to the wild coast, which has yet more stunning landscapes and beaches.
A little town called hogsback is pretty quaint and artsy, which could be worth a stop. Or we go over to lesotho or its border region.
The landscape here is a different kind of stunning - imagine iceland, but hot and less water, with antelope. 
This area is known as the Drakensbergs mountains and has a bunch of awesome hikes that we could do such as:
- Giants Castle
- Mweni pass (the light version, nto the 3 day one)
- TODO - theres more

## The north

In my opinion, the north is a bit shite. Its the industrial center of south africa (and probably africa) and theres not much there,
other than my family lol. But you can meet them a different time, as I'll have seen them before your arrive. 
Dont want my aunty to give you an impromptu cummunion lololol.

Kruger park is the main attraction in the north, which we could do if you want to get as close as possible to living jurassic park.
Its the size of wales (not even kidding), so to see lots of animals you'd need to spend a few days there.

If you're feeling super adventurous and have holiday days to burn, we could go to mozambique. 
I'll bet $50 you've never met someone whos been there on holiday, and thats their loss. Welcome to the tropics! 
This place has all of the fresh fruit you could dream of, and beaches that would meet the honeymoon destination standard, 
but without all of those annoying honeymooners! Its definitely the road less travelled, but its prpetty epic.
Although you might be sick of beaches by this point in the trip.

And boom, time to :plane: home :flag-us:
