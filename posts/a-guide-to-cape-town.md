## General Advice
Cape town is a pretty light introduction to the chaos of african cities. For the most part, its perfectly safe, especially if you stick to the main areas like the city bowl, green point, gardens, sea point etc.

Areas like Observatory and Woodstock can feel a little bit more "dodgy" but its actually fine - i personally quite like it there. Kind of like east london in the 90's I guess.

The townships like khayelitsha and Phillipi arent recommended for tourists unless you go with a guide.

Walking around the city at night - lots of people will warn you of the dangers. Personally I'd say its fine. Just be aware of your surroundings. Common sense stuff, like dont flash cash etc. For the most part, just be a bit more careful that you would in europe.

## Getting Around

MyCiti bus - super convinient and cheap. Need to go into townto get yourself a bus card though as it doesnt take cash.

Uber - VERY cheap

Car Hire - I'd recommend this, as even though cape town is fairly walkable, theres so much more to see in the surroundings, and some spectacular drives such as Chapmans Peaks (keep cash for the tolls though).

## Table Mountain

Skeleton Gorge hike

Starts off in the botanical gardens. Its a fairly tiring hike (around 8 ours 1 way), but good fun and you'll see all the most beautiful bits. 
Includes some minimal scrabling but its pretty easy if you're fit and healthy. 
Just make sure you take enough water - from experience, 1 litre per person isnt enough (lol).
Theres a couple damns on the mountain that are super picturesque that you can cool off in as well.
Keep an eye out for the wild flowers - certain times of the year, talbe mountain is covered flowers and its v pretty.

You can get the cablecar down.

There are loads of other routes up the mountain. You can also get the cablecar up the mountain if you dont fancy a hike.

## Kirtenbosch

Often botanical gardens can be a bit boring, but this one isnt - well worth a visit. Around 4% of the worlds flowering plant species come from the western cape, so seeing the native flora in their natural habitat, on the side of table mountain is pretty epic.

## Hout bay

One of my favorite places in the world. Really beautiful little fishing town surrounded by montains with a pretty little beach. Very laid back, very enjoyable.
There have a really nice market on the weekends with all sorts of food and drinks. Highly recommend. Also a good place to get a nice little souvenir. 

## City Bowl

Most people say you sould go to Long Street - its like the main strip in cape town. Its not bad, but there are much nicers areas.
Kloof street is a street/area with nicer bars and cafes

Some ones of note in the city bowl are:

- Madam Taitou - Ethiopian
- Bo-Kaap kombuis - Traditional cape malay food
- SeaBreeze fish and shell - excellent sea food
- Shift Espresso Bar in green point - really good coffee and breakfast/lunch
- The Power and the Glory - really good coffee and breakfast/lunch. Also a vibey bar at night
- The Shack - personal favorite dive bar. Loads of pool tables. Chess nights on thursdays. People there tend to be super friendly and its easy to make some friends but just challening someone to a game of pool.


Overall, cape town is a miss-match of cultures which means theres a tonne of different foods to try and its pretty easy to find somewhere good to eat.


## Kalk bay

Small seaside town about 30 minutes fro mthe city center. Very laid back. Kalkies is a very authentic and very good fishermans restuarant there with the local special beign a fish called Snoek. Can probably see some sealions hanging out around the resturaunt as well.

## Bo Kaap

Super interesting neighborhood on the side of signal hill. Traditionally its a muslim neighborhood where people are decendants of malaysian labourers. Know for its colorful houses, theres a few nice art galleries and lots of really good food. Worth having a wander around there.

## Caamps Bay

Must be one of the most beautiful city beaches in the world. Techincally, its just outside of cape town (around 20 minute drive from the city center). It can be a little busy as times, but normally its not too packed, and the scenery is stunning. Water v cold though as its the atlantic. Lots of good bars and resturaunts along the beach.

## Cape Point

A bit out of the way, but if you hire a car, its worth the very scenic drive. Can probably get a bus as well. 
Its not quite the southern most tip of africa, but its close - supposedly its where the atlantic meets the indian ocean (does anyone really know where they meet though?!).

A fun part of going there is that Baboons often hang around. They're not always there, but they probably are. They're dickheads, but cool to see.

## Franshoek 

About 1.5 hours from cape town by car (uber will only be like 30 quid). Its a very beautiful little town with lots of history nestled between the mountains. Loads of vienyards - they have a wine tram, which takes you to the various local vineyards so you can sample the wine. 
Even if you're not a massive wine fan, its well worth doing for the experience The vineyards tend to be very picturesque and its a very nice way to spend a day. Excellent way to catch a buzz. Also have a little market on the weekends which often has live music.

## Muizenberg

On the southern side of cape town - abosulutely massive beach. Very popular for surfing as the water is a bit warmer on this side.

## Signal hill

Little hill thingy overlooking green point. Great place to watch the sunset (although be prepared to walk down, as the traffic getting down the single lane road once the sun goes down is awful).

You can also do paragliding from here - costs around 60 quid per person. Just turn up in the morning and book yourelf a slot.

## Observatory and Woodstock

Kind of an up and coming area - quite trendy and popular with university students/young professionals. Lots of hipster bars and what not. Also quite a few good thrift stores if you want to get some more colourful clothing. Probably dont go round htere at night unless you back yourself as being quite street smart.

## Boulders beach 

Not much of a beach, but it has penguins! Watch out though, they bite - I still have the scar. 

## Other

Theres obviously loads more things to do, like the hike up lions head (go in the morning otherwise it can be v busy), but hpefully this will give you a decent overview of stuff to do and areas to hang out in.

also worth seeing if theres any rugby games on at cape town stadium - the Stormers are the local team. Tickets are quite cheap and its always a good vibe.
